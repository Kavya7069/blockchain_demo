# blockchain_demo

This project implements a simple blockchain using Python, along with the Postman API for interaction. The blockchain allows for the creation of new blocks, addition of transactions, and ensures the integrity of the chain through proof-of-work and validation methods. The blockchain can also be decentralized by connecting multiple nodes.
